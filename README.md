# BedrockCSS

Always inheriting the userâ€™s preferred font size. The one they choose in their browser or on their system. Even if they did not explicitly choose one (because the default was maybe good enough).

## Getting Started

To use BedrockCSS, simply include the `bedrock.min.css` file in your HTML document.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/bedrock.min.css" />
```
